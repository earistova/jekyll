  <!-- <h1 class="title is-5">Art-gallery 29 Bd. Exelmans Paris 75016</h1> -->
    The time when all the galleries stay closed I had a chance to expose 
    my artworks in the marvellous office space at 29 Bd. Exelmans Paris 75016. 
    7 artworks are represented where including the flagship '2020' painting.<br> 
    For the best experince, take a RDV with me, as I can't always be present in the gallery.
    All my contacts are listed at the bottom of the page.<br> 
    Othewise, the company director Laurent will be happy to show you the collection. <br><br>
    Open every Mon-Sat 10-19h .<br> 
    From 24 Nov to 24 Dec 2020. <br>
