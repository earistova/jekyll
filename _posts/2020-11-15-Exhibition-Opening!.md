We are living a difficult time. Time of war. Where we are all together.

 

This series is inspired by travels in France and abroad between two lockdowns and earlier. And these inspirations gave birth to a new collection of abstract landscapes. What is most important in these works - is the perception of color and space. I tried to avoid the details. And the most inspiration for me is the feeling of freedom, of free spirit.

 

The main work of this exhibition is called “2020” (or “The Night Glow”). Realised in acrylic on canvas 210 x 140 cm (83x55 in). The painting presents a vast abstract landscape made in intense red colour. The work reveals to the metaphor of "our peace" and "their war" and to the issue of freedom. There is a thin (red) line between the two concepts. In fact, the Earth is the one and what happens here concerns everyone. Unfortunately, we understand this through our own experience only when we face it personally. Then a beautiful sunset appears in a completely different light. The light of the bloody glow. And we can read through the beautiful natural phenomenon a real catastrophe which can burn us all.

 

The main message of the exhibition is the idea of enjoying and valuing our life and our freedom with respect for others, especially during the difficult period of war. I believe that true freedom begins inside of us.
